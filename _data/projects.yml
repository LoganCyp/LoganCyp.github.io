- project: UAV RF Fingerprinting and Modulation Classification
  role: Team Lead, Developer
  duration: 2023 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: Created a project that uses radio-frequency data derived from various UAVs with labels for signal fingerprint and modulation type. The data is engineered to analyze I/Q, Amp-Phase, Constellation Plots, and Power Spectral Density plots to develop a predictive convolutional neural network that can accurately classify the signal sender and modulation type. The project generates external data using variational autoencoders and fast gradient sign method to ensure a robust model is created.

- project: Boeing Transformation Challenge; Cultural Nuance Translation
  role: Team Member
  duration: 2024 &mdash; Present
  # url: "#"
  description: Developed and pitched an idea at the Boeing Transformation Challenge at Virginia Tech to translate cultural nuances between Boeing workforce platforms. Currently developing the model to fine tune a generative artificial intelligence model with cultural nuance data.
